    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 stalks celery, sliced</li>
            <li>2 large carrots, cut into large matchsticks</li>
            <li>1/2 sweet onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 green onions, sliced</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
            <li>Whisk together the soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, honey, and ginger in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat; cook and stir the celery, carrots, and sweet onion in the hot oil until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the spaghetti and soy sauce mixture; cook and stir until the noodles are hot and have absorbed the liquid, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with the green onions to serve.</li>
        </ol>
